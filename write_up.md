### Problem

-What is the problem you're trying to solve, why is it important to solve it?
-How does it affect people? How does it affect you?

### Solution
In your report, explain briefly why you think your chosen metric(s) is/are applicable.

### Data
What is the size of your dataset?
How many features are present?
Which features seem most promising?
Are there any categorical variables that may need to be converted?
Which ones would you expect to perform well?
How easy is it to convert the available data into a suitable form?

### Model
Create your solution by using an existing library (such as scikit-learn) or rolling your own implementation (code must be submitted using Python 2.7). Keep in mind that for a real-world challenge, an existing implementation may not work nicely out of the box. You will likely have to tweak parameters, and transform the input to get better results.

What pre-processing operations do you have to carry out on the features? (e.g. scaling, normalization, selection, transformation)
Are there any incomplete data points or outliers that you have to work around?
Once you have a first-pass solution, try to gauge how well it performs.

Using the metric(s) you defined earlier, measure your current performance. Is it close to what you expected?
Are there any better metrics you can come up with?
Feel free to revise your problem and solution descriptions according to what you have learned so far.

### Conclusion
Refine your solution

Iterate on your solution to make it as good as you can.

For each version of your solution, track what changes you make and how they affect performance.
Does it ever become worse? If so, note down and figure out why.
Your final solution may or may not be exactly like you initially planned. But that is okay!

Report how your project evolved, and what changes you made to your specifications (if any).
What was your experience like working on this project? Do you feel more confident taking on open-ended projects like these in the future?
